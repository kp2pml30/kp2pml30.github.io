<hr />

My name is Kira &gt;&lt;&gt; Prokopenko. I completed bachelor's degree at ITMO university, and my thesis was focused on language interoperability and it's optimization and support in JIT, GC and runtime. Iâ€™m also interested in game development and visual art. This blog is an outlet for me to talk about my research, technological interests, hobbies and ideas.
