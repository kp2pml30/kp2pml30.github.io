However, it&#39;s impossible to ignore the downsides</br><h2>&quot;Sleep Deprivation&quot;</br></h2>While using AI speeds me up, as I work on critical infrastructure I need to review all of their code, which drains my resources extremely fast as well. Moreover, because it takes some time for them to research or write code, I usually simultaneously work on two independent parts and need to keep them both in my mind. But because 95% of the typing is done by AI, no routines are left for your humble meat servant</br>I feel that removing all routine is somewhat comparable to removing sleep because &quot;it is a waste of time&quot;.

My colleague from Huawei always said that a programming language must be &quot;reader-first&quot;. But AI-generated text is definitely creator-first</br><h2>Final Words</br></h2>I feel like there will be major negative consequences for the programming industry as a whole. Also, recently it has finally started to feel to me like we are cooked...
